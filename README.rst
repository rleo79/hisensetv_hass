**Update 2020-07-09** This repository is no longer maintained.  I do not use this component anymore.  I found that my TV would drop the Ethernet connection and require physically unplugging/replugging it to maintain connectivity.

Installation
************
Place the ``custom_components`` folder into your configuration directory
(or add its contents to an existing ``custom_components`` folder).

Alternatively install with `HACS <https://hacs.xyz/>`_.

Authentication
**************
On most models you will need to perform one-time authentication for the API
to work.

This authentication can be performed on any device to authenticate the API
on all devices.  In other words you can use your local PC to authenticate
your home-assistant server.

.. code:: bash

    pip install hisensetv
    hisensetv 10.0.0.28 --authorize

See `newAM/hisensetv <https://github.com/newAM/hisensetv>`_ for more details.

Configuration
*************

.. code:: yaml

    switch:
      - platform: hisensetv
        host: 10.0.0.28
        mac: ab:cd:ef:12:34:56
        name: tv
        ssl: true

* ``host`` is the (static) IP address of your TV.
* ``mac`` if the TVs MAC address for Wake on LAN (WOL).

Warning
*******
This is provided **as-is**.
This is my first time going this deep into homeassistant and I have no idea
if I have horribly messed something up.
